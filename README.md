# dynamic-tstorm-opm
Model evaluation code for the LSTM described in "Dynamic Modeling of Power Outages Caused by Thunderstorms".

To run the LSTM model with leave-one-storm-out cross-validation on the data described in the manuscript (and included here), run the command
```{bash}
python3 lstm_CT_loso.py
```
directly from the dynamic-tstorm-opm directory.
